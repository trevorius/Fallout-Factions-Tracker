# Cursor AI Configuration for Next.js Project

## Project Context

- Next.js 15 with App Router and src directory
- always use src directory
- TurboPack
- AuthJS
- always use typescript
- Server Components
- Native fetch API for data fetching
- No state management library
- Motion for animations
- No complex interactions
- Prisma ORM for database access

## Preferred Behaviors

- Prioritize server-side component suggestions
- Always use the src directory for project code
- always use the app directory for the routes
- Suggest simple, performant solutions
- Avoid complex state management patterns

## Code Style

- Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript
- Follow Next.js best practices
- Implement tailwind classes correctly
- Maintain clean, documented code

## AI Assistance Rules

1. Prioritize:

   - Server component implementations
   - tailwind class usage
   - Performance optimizations
   - Clean code structure

2. Avoid Suggesting:

   - Complex state management solutions
   - Animation libraries
   - Custom styling when tailwind classes do not suffice
   - Client-side heavy implementations

3. Code Generation:

   - Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
   - Add type hints where helpful
   - Include error handling
   - Follow Next.js naming conventions

4. Documentation:

   - Explain key implementation decisions
   - Note tailwind class usage
   - Highlight server/client component boundaries
   - Include performance considerations

5. commit messages:

   - use imperative, present tense
   - include the file name
   - include a short description of the changes
   - include the issue number if applicable
   - include the user who requested the change if applicable
   - include the ticket number if applicable
   - include the ticket title if applicable
   - ALWAYS start the message with a gitmoji followed by a colon and text corresponding to the emoji.
   - use gitmoji.dev for reference
   - Use Gitmojis
   - do not always use :sparkles: for every commit. use the gitmoji site to find the best emoji for the commit.
   - message should be no more than 100 characters

6. prisma:
   - prisma schema file is /prisma/schema.prisma
   - prisma client is in /src/lib/prisma.ts

## File Organization

- Follow Next.js 15 app directory structure
- Keep components modular
- Separate server and client concerns
- Maintain clear import/export patterns
